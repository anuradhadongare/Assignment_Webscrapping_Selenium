1. The above tree works are proposed as a remedy to the differential foundation movement at the insured property and to ensure the long-term stability of the building.

2. The above tree works are proposed to limit the extent and need for expensive and disruptive engineering repair works at the insured property. In this instance the estimated repair costs are likely to vary between ?11,000 and ?125,000, depending upon whether the tree can be removed or must remain.

3. The above tree works are proposed to limit the duration of any claim period and therefore allow the landowner their right to the peaceful enjoyment of their property.

4. It is the case that an alternative to felling such as pruning or significant 'pollarding' of the tree would not provide a reliable or sustainable remedy to the subsidence in this case. We do not consider that any other potential means of mitigation, including root barriers, would be effective or appropriate in the circumstances.

5. We are satisfied that the evidence obtained following completion of our Arboricultural Implication Assessment report completed 19/06/2019, clearly links the T5 Beech tree as the cause of damage to the risk address
